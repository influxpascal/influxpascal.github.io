<h2>Shadokean proverbs for researchers</h2>
<img src="../images/shadok.jpg"/>

<p><font size="3"><b>“Pourquoi faire simple quand on peut faire compliqué ?”</b><br />
  (Why do it the easy way when you can do it the hard way ?)<br />
<b>“Ce n’est qu’en essayant continuellement que l’on finit par réussir…. En d’autres termes… Plus ça rate et plus on a de chances que ça marche…”</b><br />
(When one tries continuously, one ends up succeeding. Thus, the more one fails, the greater the chance that it will work)<br />
<b>“S’il n’y a pas de solution. C’est qu’il n’y a pas de problème.”</b><br />
  (If there is no solution, it is because there is no problem)<br />
<b>“Quand on ne sait pas où on va, il faut y aller…. et le plus vite possible”</b><br />
  (When you don’t know where to go, you should go there .. and as quick as possible)<br />

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

<p> The main focus of our research are the understanding of self-organization of matter at various scales, from the collective interactions of microscopic particles
to geometrically constrained elastic slender objects. These studies, combining simulations, experiments and theoretical models, 
rely on concepts from out of equilibrium statistical physics, Soft Matter Physics and continuum mechanics.  <br>
For example, we try to understand how granular matter flows, the collective self-organization of active particles, 
the formation of wrinkles or elastic singularities in twisted ribbons, compressed thin sheets.<br>

We also apply our knowledge in elasticity and fluid flow 
to understand the structure and function of biological organisms. 
Our works aim to contribute to answer fundamental questions in the living world, such as: 
How do mechanics  determine the feeding and drinking strategy of animals ? 
How do elastic instability explain the various shapes of plants ?  
</p>

<!-- <p><b>Soft Matter Physics</b><br />
Soft Matter is usually split in two main group: particles in equilibrium with a thermal bath (polymers, colloids) and athermal systems such as
  granular matter. A third group based on the concept of Active Particle recently appears. In these out-of-equilibrium systems, the energy is 
  injected at the scale of the particles, in contrast to classical dissipative structures where energy is provided through boundaries.
</p> -->

<!-- <p><b>Mechanics of Slender Structures</b> (sheets, rods, ribbons, shells and balloons)<br />
Soft elastic structures, i.e., involving at least one very small dimension, 
  are prone to undergo mechanical instability. By confining a thin sheet in a empty ball, in a curtain-shape, twisting a ribbon 
  or gluing a flexible film on top of a deformable foundation, you can observe the growth of various patterns such as, 
  regular wrinkles or a network of stress focusing singularities. 
  
  Our research aims to understand the formation of these complex patterns from a combination of geometry and energy minimisation 
  coupled to nonlinearities.
