Within the InFluX lab, our research activities are focused on the fundamental understanding of the mechanics of soft matter, of slender objects, i.e., plates, rods, ribbons, shells and their application to the Biomechanics of living organisms. Our strategy to tackle a research problem is based on controlled desktop experiments, supported by a theoretical analysis using scaling laws and dimensional analysis, able to predict the result of observations.

I like the idea that Research is a kind of labyrinth built by the researchers themselves !
