Within the InFluX lab, our research group focus his activities on the fundamental understanding of *soft matter* through experiments, simulations and statistical physics, on *Self-organization* from geometrically constrained sheets, rods, ribbons, shells and the *biomechanics* of living organisms. 

Our strategy to tackle a problem is based on controlled desktop experiments, supported by theoretical models and numerical simulations.

I like the idea that Research is a kind of labyrinth built by the researchers themselves !
