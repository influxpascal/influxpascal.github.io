Within the InFluX lab, our research group focus his activities on the fundamental understanding of *soft matter* through experiments, simulations and statistical physics, on *Self-organization* from geometrically constrained sheets, rods, ribbons, shells and the *biomechanics* of living organisms. 

I like the idea that Research is a kind of labyrinth, but unlike the labyrinth-jail proposed here by Franquin (excerpt from *“idées noires”*), researchers build their labyrinth by themselves !
