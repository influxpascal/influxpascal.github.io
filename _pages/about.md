Within the InFluX lab, our research group focus his activities on the fundamental understanding of soft matter through statistical physics, on pattern formation from constrained sheets, rods, ribbons, shells and their application to the Biomechanics of living organisms. Our strategy to tackle a problem is based on controlled desktop experiments, supported by theoretical models and numerical simulations.

I like the idea that Research is a kind of labyrinth built by the researchers themselves !
